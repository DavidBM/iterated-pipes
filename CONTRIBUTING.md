Hi! Thanks for thinking in contributing!

## Features

If you though that you would like to add a new method, first it would be nice if you ask in a issue.

If you have already implemented a new method or you want to implement a new one, there is some think to keep in mind.

- Try to not modify `sequential` and parallel `methods` and build your method with a combination of these. 
- Test everything. 100% of test coverage is not optional. 
- Add test for trying to break you code. Randon inputs and test of when the code should thrown an exception.

## Bugs

Open an issue or create a pull request. Add tests for checking that bug, in that way the bug will never happen again.

Hope the library to be useful! :D
